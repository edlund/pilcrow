# Pilcrow

This is a work in progress. It will be a work in progress
for quite some time. It might become something interesting
if things go as planned.

The idea is to build a somewhat simple, but extendable CMS/WRS
that is focused on allowing developers to create custom sites
quickly that are relatively easy for editors to manage.

There is obviously no shortage of good (and bad) CMS/WRS software
available, so it is highly unlikely Pilcrow will ever become
popular; it mostly exists as "therapy work" for its author (and
possibly any future contributors) - an answer to the question
"How would I build it?"
